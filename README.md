BLOOMS
======
BLOOMS is a tool for ontology matching.It utilizes information from Wikipedia category hierarchy and from the web to identify subclass relationship between entities. 


How does it work
======
If you like reading papers, check out

If you dont,

Get the code from here and try to mess with it. It is a better use of your time then reading xkcd or oatmeal or watching Honey Boo Boo.

If none of this works for you (First of all.. what are you doing here then?)

Too bad.

What if something is broken
======
(a) If you can code, fix it and let me know. I will be happy to put the fix up after I verify it. Credit will be given where it is due.

	OR

(b) Put it in the bug tracking, I will try to look at it.


How do I install it
======
Check the file install.txt within the project folder

Can I get commit rights
=======
No

Is it still in active development
=======
Define active
If my occasional ramblings and musings and actions related to it considered active, then yes. If not, then NO.

What about the dependencies? Do you own them?
=======
Everything you should need to run it is in the lib folder. I don't own any rights to those JAR files. They belong to their creators and organizations. I am just bundling them to make it easier for you and me.

Can you give me X component which was reported in your paper?
=======
Short answer is No. 

Long answer is
I had placed the components on a server while I was in school. The server was shuffled around a bunch of times and eventually I lost track of where things went and I got involved with other projects which I found interesting. 

Do you collaborate if I have an interesting idea to improve it?
=======
May be..

You sound like an interesting fella

Aww.. thank you.. May be we should be friends on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/prateekj/
